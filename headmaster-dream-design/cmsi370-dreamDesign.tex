This paper explains my dream web interface for the headmaster web-app.  The headmaster web-app is an online database for a school that contains students info, events, grants, and other school related functions.  The paper will explain the top-level layout, a couple usage scenarios, reasons for the choices I make, and usability metrics.  These should effectively give the reader a good idea what my dream design is.  }

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

In general, my dream design uses a mix of different interaction styles.  The choices for these styles has to do with the usability metrics in order to give the user the best experience using the web-app.  I do like the new interaction styles that involve the use of a computer's camera and speech.  Each interaction style has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Also, each user has a different mental model and experience with these interaction styles.  Thus, my dream design would like to incorporate the advantages of each interaction style to create a truly "perfect" interface.

\section{Top Level Design and Layout}

The design for my headmaster web-app is comprised of a login page, students page, grants page, events page, and a users page.

\subsection{Login Page}

For a new user or default settings, there is a standard form login design.  There are two fields, one for username and the other for password.  Inside the web-app, under the user settings, the user can edit their login preferences.  The preference options include a facial recognition login (built-in camera or attached camera through USB port),
